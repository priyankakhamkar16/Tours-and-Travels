            <p>This was the perfect way to see may different places. Some we planned from the map and others we just saw the heritage sign from the road and stopped if we had time. Would love it if the road signs indicated the distance from road to sites as it would be very helpful if on a timeline. Defiantly would get this again.</p>

            <p>We traveled the length of Britain from Dover to Hadrian's Wall over 16 days and were extremly pleased at the value the English Heritage pass. We saved over a third of the costs over eight sites including parking. Our EH guidebook is dogeared and worn and is a great souvenir of our journey. Would do it again in a heartbeat.</p>

            <p>Going into this holiday and every holiday I take, I am research girl. I trawl through everything I can find about a hotel so naturally with the reviews so good for the hotel my expectations were high! They were definitely met though and in some cases surpassed! Here is a break down of my thoughts: Location Really conveniently located from Male, especially if you arenâ€™t staying a particularly long time. </p>
